      <h2>Target Customer Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        A comprehensive target market customer analysis is one of the crucial
        components to help business with all the required information and making
        wise business decisions. The 4 most basic yet the important questions
        while formulating an analysis plan are:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Who are the potential customers?
            <br />
            Since our product is healthcare-related, our customer base includes
            every single individual in India which includes those who might be
            in a state of emergency at any point of life or already suffers from
            a disease or problem that might cause a mishap in the future. As per
            the statistics available, India on an average receives 75,000
            emergencies calls a day
          </li>
          <li>
            Where are they located?
            <br />
            The best part of our product is that it is neither restricted to any
            specific region of the country. Anyone present in any region of the
            country can access the feature as long as there is a hospital
            present in the nearby or surrounding areas.
          </li>
          <li>
            How large is our target market?
            <br />
            As mentioned, our target market includes every single individual in
            the country but going by the practicality that occurs in the
            ordinary business of life, only 10% of the total customers aware of
            the product actually avail it. This generally occurs in the case of
            a luxury but we believe that our product instead of being a luxury
            is actually a basic necessity. So, the rule of 10% customer
            acquisition actually holds, as we believe, invalid in our case and
            with that we would like to get back to the point where our target
            market basically includes every single individual
          </li>
          <li>
            What section of the society is being targeted and what income groups
            can avail the features?
            <br />
            The best part of our product is that it never charges a single rupee
            from the customer, our business model is to charge the hospitals to
            which the customers are redirected. In case of private ones, a
            commission is charged on the hospital bill of the patient while in
            the case of a government hospital, if granted the permission to get
            the software (product) implemented, no commission will be charged
            from the user or the hospital.
          </li>
        </ul>
