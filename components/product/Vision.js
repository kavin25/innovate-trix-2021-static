            We as the creators of the product see it as the next Amazon in India
            in the coming 5 years. Due to the reason that this app is a
            necessity, our vision is to partner with Google (Android) and Apple
            (iOS) to make ours a system app in their respective Operating
            Systems as our mission of launching this will only be accomplished
            when we see the app in every single smartphone in the country.
